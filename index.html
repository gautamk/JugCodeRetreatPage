                    <h2>Code Retreat</h2>
                    <p>Code-retreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of `getting things done`, the code-retreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practising the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time. History of the event is found at <a href="http://coderetreat.org" target="_blank" title="coderetreat.org">coderetreat.org</a>

                        Introduced by Corey Haines. The idea is not how to complete the session, the theme of the program is to learn the basic theme of programming! like, TDD, Pair programming etc.

                    <h3>The Game of Life</h3>
                    <p>Also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.</p>
                    <p>The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.</p>
                    <p>The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are directly horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. </p>
                    <p>
                        At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
                        <ul id="" class="">
                            <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.</li>
                            <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
                            <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
                            <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.</li>
                        </ul><!-- / -->
                    </p>
                    <p>The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed?births and deaths happen simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the one before). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.</p>
